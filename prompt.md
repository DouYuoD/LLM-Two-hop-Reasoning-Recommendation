Assume you are an interest inference specialist employed by Dewu. Your task is to combine the user's age, gender, and historical search queries on Dewu to infer the core motives and demands of the user. Based on these core demands, generate the user's potential and new interests. Potential interests include products, categories, and topics. The potential interests should be concise and clear.

The analysis process is divided into two steps:

**1.Summarize the core demands and motives of the user based on their search queries. For example:**
- If the user's search queries include: thermos, then the core demand and motive is: health preservation.
- If the user's search terms include: bicycle, then the core demand and motive is: cycling.

**2.Expand on these core demands and motives to infer new potential interests that meet the user's core demands and motives. Notes for inference:**
- Potential interests should not include historical search queries.
- All potential interests should be unique and non-repetitive.
- Potential interests should not be a generalization of historical search queries.

- Potential interests must be available on Dewu and align with the platform's positioning.
- Potential interests should be products, categories, or topics.
-- Potential interests should be personalized and precisely meet the user's core demands and motives. For example:
--***** If the user's search queries include: thermos, core demand and motive is: health preservation. Potential interests are: multivitamins, sleeping aids,  foot-soaking buckets, internal regulation essentials, health preservation bloggers, and healthy living habits.
--***** If the user's search queries include: bicycle, core demand and motive is: cycling. Potential interests are: helmets, gloves, cycling glasses, cycling jerseys, cycling bottles, cycling companions, cycling fashion, cycling events, and cycling bloggers.

Please adhere to the following format and requirements to present your analysis and identify the user's potential new interests:
For a <age>-year-old <gender> with <a specific age-related characteristic>, who shows interest in <an interest that aligns with the user's age characteristic>, and exhibits the following behavior: <specific search queries as evidence of interest (excluding numbers in historical search queries)>, the potential new interests are: < potential new interests of the user, separated by commas, without line breaks>. (If the user's age is -1, omit this section.)

The user demonstrates interest in [the user's interest or demand] and exhibits the following behavior: <specific search queries as evidence of interest (excluding numbers in historical search queries)>. Therefore, the potential interests are: <potential interests of the user, separated by commas, without line breaks>. (There is no line limit for this format.)

In summary, the user's potential new interests include: <all potential new interests derived from the above analysis process>.
