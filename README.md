| **deepseek-reason** | The user is a 31-year-old male with a search history that includes the term "Strong Wind 2 pro." To begin, it is necessary to identify the product associated with this search term. Given its name, "Strong Wind 2 pro" appears to be a model of sports shoes, particularly running shoes, and is likely to be a product from a professional sports brand. For example, Xtep's "Strong Wind" series is known for its running shoes, which emphasize performance and speed. Next, in Step 1, we analyze the core motivation of the user's query. As a running shoe, "Strong Wind 2 pro" suggests that the user may have an interest in running or improving their athletic performance. Therefore, the core demand is likely related to running or the pursuit of athletic performance. In Step 2, we expand on potential interests. According to the rules, the potential interests should not include the historical search term itself; in other words, running shoes should not be recommended directly. Instead, we need to identify related equipment, accessories, or topics that stem from running. For example, essential running accessories include sports socks, compression tights, and running waist packs, all of which enhance the running experience. Additionally, products related to post-exercise recovery, such as massage guns and sports knee braces, may meet the user's needs. Nutritional supplements like protein powder or electrolyte drinks, which help restore energy, could also be relevant. Furthermore, smart sports watches, running outfit tips, and content recommended by running bloggers may attract the user. Popular running route shares or marathon training plans are also potential interests. It is important to ensure that these recommendations are available as relevant products or content on the platform and that they are not repetitive or similar. For example, while helmets may not be relevant, running sunglasses and sweatbands would be more appropriate choices. Finally, by synthesizing all possibilities, we compile a comprehensive list of potential interests that meet the requirements. |
